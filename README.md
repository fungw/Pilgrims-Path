## Welcome
This is Pilgrims Path. A simple game that I put together for a final game project. The aim of the game is simple; guide the Pilgrim as far down the trail as possible, watch out for those pesky lightsaber-like towers!

When you've had enough of the game, make sure to check out "score.txt" in the game directory to compare your scores with your friends! 

### Instructions
* UP or DOWN to guide the Pilgrim through the perilous journey.
* SPACE to activate morphing ability; uses mana. But watch out, there will be
* a cooldown period if the Pilgrims' mana is too low!
