## Introduction
This is Pilgrims Path. A simple game that I put together for a final game project. The aim of the game is simple; guide the Pilgrim as far down the trail as possible, watch out for those pesky lightsaber-like towers! Unfortunately, the pilgrim is very old, and tends to sway from left to right while they're walking. Be careful with them; they're fragile, and good luck!

When you've had enough of the game, make sure to check out "score.csv" in the game directory to compare your scores with your friends! 

A little special feature that I have implemented is if you beat own high score in the game, you will be revived from that point onwards and be able to continue until the next time you die again. This is a once-off bonus round. It does not accumalate after you die on the bonus round. i.e. For each time you beat your own high score in normal mode, you only get one bonus round. Beating your own high score on a bonus round will not result in another bonus round.

## Instructions
* UP or DOWN to guide the Pilgrim through the perilous journey.
* SPACE to activate morphing ability; uses mana. But watch out, there will be a cooldown period if the Pilgrims' mana is too low!
* Press SPACE when *GAME OVER* is displayed to try again.
